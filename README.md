# astr-302-w21-project
Final project for astr 302 w21 

I used an SDSS query to gather data on all galaxies within 1 degree of the equatorial plane (positve redshift only) and calculated their comoving distance using hubbles law. I then plotted this data on a polar plot (limited to within 900 Mpc) that replicates the map on the universe in the paper A Map of the Universe (Gott et al.)
